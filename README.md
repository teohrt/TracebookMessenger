# Tracebook Messenger
Tracebook Messenger is a peer to peer chat application!

### How does it work?
* Assign yourself a screen name
* Have access to the entire chat history that occured before your connection
* Chat with your peers!

When a node is spun up, you can choose to connect to a peer or not. If you connect to a peer, your node is updated with the chat history and list of other connected peers. At this point all peers are simultaneously notified of the existence of the new node. Peers can come and go, but as long as there is one live node in the chat, any node that connects to it will be able to view the chat history and participate!
